Welcom to Meal Box, the first lunch-box sharing platform.

The idea is simple : 
 - you usually cook lunchbox for youself ? Just cook a couple portion more and sell them to people arroud where you work. 
 - You are tiered of overpriced poorly tasting sandwiches ? Find delicious home-made food just a few meters from you office !

This app runs on rails. It uses gems devise, ransack, cariowave, geocoder, gmaps4rails, act as commentable.
Was develop in 6 days by on person (me) with the unvaluable help of General Assembly's awesome TAs !
 
How to run the website : On local host for now ;)

What was tricky : the meal - serving structure, map and styling

Strip in a gem that I should implement if I wanned to make it really usable.

A one big bug is remaining, lets see if you can find it ^^
